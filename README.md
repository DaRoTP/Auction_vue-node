# Bidit - Auction service

**BidIt** is a web application built using Express and MongoDB on Backend, and Vue.js on Fronend. 
<br> Final project for *Web Technologies* course.
<br> This application can be operated using frontend app created in Vue ( uses passport-local strategy for authentication in clinet ) or any other client like Postman using seperate external API (external API uses passport-JWT strategy fro authentication).
Application fetures:
* Creating an auction ``two types: time limited or buy now``
* Full CRUD on auctions ``editing and deleting and auction can only be done before start of auction or if it's of type buy now before someone buys it ``
* Backend and frontend pagination
* Chat using socket.io ``application has a chat tab where you can search a user by username and message them``
* Chat notification ``if you are not foused on the chat, you will get a notification that you got a new message``
* Live bidding ``when auction starts, logged in users have acces to bidding on an item. Bids are displayed live (using socket.io) to each logged in user that takes part in bidding``
